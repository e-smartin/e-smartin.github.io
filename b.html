
<H2>Power BI: Highest Revenue Movies</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Preparation</h3>    
<div></div>
<div>The data presented in this project was extracted from 
    <a 
        href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anexo:Pel%C3%ADculas_con_las_mayores_recaudaciones"
        target="_blank"
    >
    here,
    </a> imported into Power BI directly from the web. There were some erroneous values, and some cleaning was required (e.g., numbers were not loaded as <i>number</i> but as <i>&&&&&0number.&&&&</i>).
    Once the tables were in the appropriate format, we were ready to start composing our dashboard.
    
    After exploring our tables and defining the most relevant information to show, we realized that we needed to define some measures with DAX (e.g., Gross margin) and so we did.

    At this point, we just need to present the information using the most convenient way possible by selecting
    the appropriate tools (graphs, cards, tables...) and highlighting the most relevant information (e.g., color-scale for the gross margin measure
    to highlight that movies with the highest revenues were not necessarily the most profitable).
    
    
    Please find below an instance of the mentioned dashboard.

<h3>Conclusions</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Investment and Revenue aren't linearly correlated.</li>
    <li>While the investment remains more or less the same, Revenue 
        has an aggressive increasing tendency. Note that 2020 is affected by COVID, but 
        after it, a growing tendency is observed.</li>
    <li>The most profitable movie is Wolf Warrior 2, despite there being 81 movies with higher Revenues.</li>
    <li>Most of the movie's revenue comes from outside the USA, which represents, on average, 35.02% of the total Revenue.</li>
    <li>Walt Disney, Warner Bros, Universal Pictures, and Sony Pictures represent 80% of the total Revenues.</li>
    <li>The first-week revenue seems to be a good indicator of the overall performance; 5 out of 10 movies that made it to the Top 10 in their first week ended up making the Total Top 10. Both Avatar movies weren't that popular the first week and ended up making the top 3.</li>
</ul>
