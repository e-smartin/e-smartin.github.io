<H2>Power BI: Highest Revenue Movies</h2>
    <hr>
<h3>Preparation</h3>    
<div></div>
<div>The data presented on this project was extracted from 
    <a 
        href=https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anexo:Pel%C3%ADculas_con_las_mayores_recaudaciones
        target = "_blank"
    >
    here,
    </a> importing into Power BI directly from the Web. There're some erroneous values and some cleaning was required (e.g. numbers where not loaded as <i>numbers</i> but as <i>&&&&&0number.&&&&</i>).
    Once the tables where on the appropiate format, we were 
    ready to start composing our dashboard.
    
    After exploring our tables and defining the most relevant information to show, we realized that we needed to define some measures with DAX (e.g. Gross margin) and so we did.

    At this point we just need to present the information using the most convenient way possible by selecting
    the approiate tools (graphs, cards, tables...) and highlighting the most relevant infomation (e.g. color-scale for the gross margin measure
    to highligh that movies with the highest Revenues where not necessarily the most profitable).
    
    
    Please find hereafter an instance of the mention dashboard.

<h3>Conclusions</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Investment and Revenue aren't linearly correlated.</li>
    <li>While the investment remains more or less the same, Revenue 
        has an agressive increasing tendency. Note 2020 is affected by COVID but 
        after it, a growing tendency is observed.</li>
    <li>The most profitable movie is Wolf Warrior 2, despite there are 81 movies with higher Revenues.</li>
    <li>Most of the movie's revenue comes from outside the USA, which represents on average the 35.02% of the total Revenue.</li>
    <li>Walt Disney, Warner Bros, Universal Pictures and Sony Pictures represent the 80% of the total Revenues.</li>
    <li>The first week revenue seems to be a good indicator of the overall performance, 5 out of 10 movies that made it to the Top10 on their first week, ended up making the Total Top10. Both Avatar movies weren't that popular the first week and ended up making the top 3.</li>
</ul>
